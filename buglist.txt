Project 4 Bug List

1.  Polarity scores are not 100% accurate.

2.  Search results sometimes return what we did not intend (out of context of our search)

3.  Does not run on anything other than Firefox browser.

4.  One Item search button is not alligned on the page correctly.

5.  The shown tweet box sizes are dependant on the size of the tweet themselves, so
    sometimes the spacing of the shown tweets is off and not asthetically pleasing.
